# StudentBuddy
About App : As university students there’s two things our lives revolve around (apart from studying), and that’s money and food, and when funds are running low, the corner cafe or takeaway, situated around campus and res is where we go. With Covid 19 now part of our lives indefinitely, we are faced with 2 problems, we stay in our dorms for online classes most of the day, so we need quick convenient way to order food before or after classes are done. So instead of physically going to the the cafe or takeaway and queuing to order and wait for your food, StudntBuddy will allow local takeaway outlets that don't traditionally have an app or online presence, to register on the app and with a few clicks students can pre-order their food from their favourite takeaway or cafe, just like they do from any other major fast food franchise. In addition the app will promote and support small business, marketing it to students and by so doing attracting more business for the local takeaways around varsities and res'. The business will pay a fee for registering on the app and a monthly fee for being a vendor on the app and this is primarily how we will generate an income from it.
The aim is to expand StudentBuddy into a comprehensive student app, where it will become a one-stop, student services app, allowing students to access any student essential or non-essential service they might need access to that will add value to their time at university.
